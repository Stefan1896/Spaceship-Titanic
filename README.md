# Spaceship Titanic (Python)
I done this project on Kaggle, where I participated in a Getting Started Competition using Python. The project includes an extensive EDA along with some basic Machine Learning.

The project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/elky96/spaceship-titanic-extensive-eda-xgboost).
